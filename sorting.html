    <h1>Sorting</h1>
    <p>Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. In this course, we studied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comparison-based sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.</li>
        <li>Non-comparison-based sorting algorithms like Counting Sort and Radix Sort.</li>
        <li>Time and space complexity analysis of various sorting algorithms.</li>
        <li>Choosing the appropriate sorting algorithm based on input size and requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the challenges in learning/understanding sorting algorithms?</li>
        <p>Understanding the working of different algorithms and their complexities can be challenging. Visualizing how elements are rearranged and identifying the best-fit algorithm for a specific problem requires practice.</p>
        <li>What are the challenges in correlating sorting algorithms with real-world applications?</li>
        <p>Real-world scenarios often involve large datasets or specific constraints. Applying the right sorting algorithm requires an understanding of these constraints and the trade-offs between speed and memory usage.</p>
        <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach/design technique when solving a complex problem using sorting?</li>
        <p>The choice of a sorting algorithm depends on factors like the size of the dataset, the need for stability, and memory limitations. For example, Merge Sort is preferred for linked lists, while Quick Sort is efficient for arrays with average-case performance.</p>
