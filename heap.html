    <h1>Heap</h1>
    <p>A heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In this course, we covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding the min-heap and max-heap properties.</li>
        <li>Inserting elements into a heap while maintaining the heap property.</li>
        <li>Extracting the minimum or maximum element efficiently.</li>
        <li>Applications of heaps, such as priority queues and heap sort.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the challenges in learning/understanding heaps?</li>
        <p>Learning heaps can be challenging due to their abstract nature. Visualizing the tree structure and implementing heap operations like insertion and extraction can be complex for beginners.</p>
        <li>What are the challenges in correlating heaps with real-world applications?</li>
        <p>Connecting heaps to practical applications, such as priority queues in scheduling systems or heap sort in data processing, requires understanding their efficiency and limitations in specific contexts.</p>
        <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach/design technique when solving a complex problem using heaps?</li>
        <p>Using a heap is most efficient when the problem involves repeated access to the minimum or maximum element, such as in scheduling or merging sorted arrays. The choice of a min-heap or max-heap depends on the problem requirements.</p>
