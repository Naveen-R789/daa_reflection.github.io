    <h1>Graph Algorithms</h1>
    <p>Graph algorithms are fundamental in solving problems involving networks, paths, and connectivity in graphs. In this topic, we covered various algorithms used to traverse and analyze graphs, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Depth-First Search (DFS).</li>
        <li>Breadth-First Search (BFS).</li>
        <li>Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest paths.</li>
        <li>Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms for minimum spanning trees.</li>
        <li>Topological Sorting for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).</li>
        <li>Bellman-Ford Algorithm for shortest paths with negative weights.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the challenges in learning/understanding graph algorithms?</li>
        <p>Graph algorithms can be challenging because they require understanding complex data structures like adjacency lists and matrices. In addition, some algorithms involve recursion or multiple steps that must be carefully followed. The challenge increases when dealing with large or weighted graphs, or when algorithms must be modified for specific use cases like shortest path in a weighted graph or detecting cycles.</p>
        <li>What are the challenges in correlating graph algorithms with real-world applications?</li>
        <p>Graph algorithms are widely used in areas like social networks, routing, web page ranking, and network design. However, applying them to real-world problems can be difficult due to the dynamic nature of data, large graph sizes, and the computational cost. Optimization and tuning of graph algorithms are essential to make them feasible in real-world applications, especially for big data.</p>
        <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach/design technique when solving a graph problem?</li>
        <p>To determine the most efficient approach, we analyze the graph's structure and the problemâ€™s requirements. For example, if the graph is dense, an adjacency matrix may be more efficient for certain algorithms. If the problem involves finding shortest paths, Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford may be used. Depending on whether the graph is directed or undirected, or if it's a weighted graph, different algorithms may be more efficient or applicable. Profiling and testing under real-world conditions often reveal the best approach.</p>
