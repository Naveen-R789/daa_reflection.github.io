    <h1>DFS and BFS</h1>
    <p>Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms. In this course, we explored:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How DFS uses a stack (or recursion) to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</li>
        <li>How BFS uses a queue to explore neighbors level by level.</li>
        <li>Applications of DFS and BFS in real-world problems such as maze solving and shortest path determination.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the challenges in learning/understanding DFS and BFS?</li>
        <p>The key challenges include understanding the difference between the two algorithms and when to use each. Beginners often struggle with implementing recursive DFS or managing the queue in BFS.</p>
        <li>What are the challenges in correlating DFS and BFS with real-world applications?</li>
        <p>Applying these algorithms requires identifying scenarios like network analysis, AI search strategies, or pathfinding where graph traversal is applicable. Recognizing graph representation in real-world problems is also a challenge.</p>
        <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach/design technique when solving a complex problem using DFS or BFS?</li>
        <p>The choice between DFS and BFS depends on the problem. For example, BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, while DFS is more suited for exploring all possible solutions or paths.</p>
