    <h1>Time Complexity Analysis</h1>
    <p>In this course, we explored the concept of time complexity to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. Key exercises and structured enquiries involved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notations.</li>
        <li>Analyzing algorithms to determine their time complexity.</li>
        <li>Comparing time complexities to choose efficient solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the challenges in learning/understanding time complexity?</li>
        <p>Understanding time complexity can be challenging due to the abstract nature of asymptotic analysis. Beginners often struggle with comprehending notations like Big-O and how they translate into real-world performance. Additionally, identifying worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios requires practice and critical thinking.</p>
        <li>What are the challenges in correlating time complexity with real-world applications?</li>
        <p>Applying time complexity to real-world problems can be difficult because real-world performance is influenced by factors like hardware, data structure implementation, and algorithm optimization. Bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and practical outcomes requires experience and experimentation.</p>
        <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach/design technique when solving a complex problem?</li>
        <p>To determine the most efficient approach, one must first analyze the problem requirements and constraints. This involves understanding the input size, expected operations, and performance expectations. Comparing various algorithms and their complexities helps select the best fit. Practical testing and profiling can further validate the choice.</p>
